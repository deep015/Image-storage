***Build a Professional, Interactive Image Uploader with React & TailwindCSS

Images are central to modern web applications, whether it’s a portfolio, social media app, or an admin dashboard. A smooth, interactive image uploader not only enhances user experience but also makes your application feel modern and professional.

In this project, I built a professional Image Uploader using React, TailwindCSS, and Zustand, combining modern design trends with interactive features for a polished user experience.

##Key Features
1. Drag & Drop and Click-to-Upload

Users can either click to select files or drag and drop images into the upload area. This provides flexibility and makes the uploader intuitive.

2. Responsive Image Grid

Uploaded images are displayed in a responsive, glassmorphic grid, adapting seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

3. Interactive Image Cards

Each card displays metadata like format, size, and upload date. Hovering reveals actions like download, delete, and preview, keeping the UI clean but interactive.

4. Preview Modal

Clicking an image opens a full-size preview modal, providing a detailed view without leaving the page.

5. Like Button

Users can “like” images, toggling a heart icon, which makes the experience more interactive and engaging.

6. Bulk Actions

Manage images efficiently with download all or delete all buttons, perfect for large collections.

7. Search & Filter

A search bar helps users quickly find images by name, enhancing navigation in bigger galleries.

Design & UX

The app uses glassmorphism for cards, soft gradient backgrounds, and subtle animations to create a modern SaaS feel. Hover effects, modal transitions, and pulsing icons make the interface engaging but professional.

Colors are carefully chosen for readability, with muted grays for text and bright accents for action buttons, ensuring a visually balanced UI.

Technology Stack

React – Component-based UI

TailwindCSS – Modern styling with utility classes

Zustand – Lightweight state management

React Toastify – Clean notifications
